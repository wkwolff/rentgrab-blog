When Mike Thompson started Thompson Equipment Rentals in 2023, he had just five pieces of construction equipment and operated from a small lot in suburban Dallas. Two years later, his business has grown 300%, expanded to three locations, and manages over 150 pieces of equipment. Here's how RentGrab helped transform his small rental operation into a thriving regional business.
